# Microbenchmark

Run `cargo bench` in this directory. This will run many
microbenchmarks, and approximately 5 minutes later, it will produce a
report of the microbenchmarks in the `target/criterion` directory. A
quick high-level summary of the benchmarks can be found in
`target/criterion/read_u64/report/violin.svg`
